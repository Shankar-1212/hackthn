# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Deep Learning and Synthetic Data Generation

## Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, with millions of women diagnosed each year. Early detection plays a critical role in improving survival rates, and mammography is one of the most effective screening tools available. However, identifying subtle abnormalities in mammogram images can be challenging due to the complexity and variability in breast tissue appearances.

This project addresses the challenge of early and accurate breast cancer detection using deep learning and synthetic data generation. By building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on both real and synthetic mammogram images, we aim to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis.

## Key Features
- **CNN-based Model**: A deep learning model trained on real mammogram data to classify breast images as healthy or containing lesions (cancerous or non-cancerous).
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Utilizes a Stable Diffusion model to create synthetic mammogram images based on specific mammogram characteristics (e.g., view, density), expanding the dataset and improving model performance.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming were applied to the dataset to prevent overfitting and increase model robustness.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a final validation accuracy of 98% after retraining with synthetic data.
- **Healthcare Impact**: Demonstrates the potential of AI and synthetic data to assist healthcare professionals in making more accurate diagnoses.

## Setup
- Clone the repository
```git clone https://github.com/Shankar-1212/hackthn.git```
- Install dependencies
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Run the application
```python app.py```

## Technologies Used
- **Stable Diffusion**: For generating synthetic mammogram images.
- **CNN for Image Classification**: To classify breast images as healthy or containing lesions.
- **YOLO for Real-Time Object Detection**: Used to detect abnormalities in mammogram images in real-time.
- **Gradio for Interactive Web Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for testing the model and viewing results.

## Results
After incorporating synthetic data into the training process, the modelâ€™s performance improved significantly:
- **Initial Accuracy**: 50.50% on validation data.
- **Final Accuracy**: 98% on the validation set after retraining with an expanded dataset including synthetic data.

## Real-Time Abnormal Tissue Detection
Our model is capable of detecting abnormal tissue in real-time, as shown in the example image below:

## Synthetic Images Generated by Our Model
The Stable Diffusion model generates synthetic mammogram images that enhance the dataset. Here is an example of a synthetic image:
